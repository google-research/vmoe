  is not a 1-to-1 mapping. If a global slice intersects with a checkpoint slice,
  then part of the array in the checkpoint needs to be restored to fill part of
  the local array.

    - The checkpoint shard to be restored.
    - The (global) checkpoint slice that needs to be restored from the shard.
    - The (sub)slice in the checkpoint chunk that needs to be copied to
    - the (sub)slice in the local array.

  Example:

    [[0, 2],
     [1, 3]]

    Now, suppose that we want to checkpoint the array using 2 checkpoint shards.
